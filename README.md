# Resume-the-Hard-Way

Takes a resume in JSON format and lays it out on the page with DOM manipulation. This is me playing around and getting comfortable with Node.js, npm, webpack, Github, DOM manipulation, and whatever else occurs to me to try out here.

Up next: 

- Find some sort of HTML to PDF converter.
- Add name to <title> tag.
- Go over the code and see what can be modularized and cleaned up.
- Clean up those styles, good grief.
