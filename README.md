# Resume-the-Hard-Way

Takes a simple project-oriented resume in JSON format and lays it out on the page with DOM manipulation. This is me playing around and getting comfortable with Node.js, npm, webpack, Github, DOM manipulation, and whatever else occurs to me to try out here.

Responsive design features a two-column layout for larger screens and a one-column layout for small screens and print (or print-to-PDF).
